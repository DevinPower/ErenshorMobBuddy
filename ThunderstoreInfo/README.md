# Overview
A mod for tracking mobs in the zone. A side panel on the right will show what has been spawned into the zone already.

Ex:
```/track Tinkles```

Names aren't case sensitive but do need to be exact. Typing the same name in again will remove that entry. Typing ```/track clear``` will remove all mobs.

# Changelog
## 1.0.1
- Mob status now accurately reflected in side panel.
- Active mobs in side panel are now displayed in yellow.
